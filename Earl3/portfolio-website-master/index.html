          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="intro">I am Earl Louie Villanueva, advocating for (Sustainable Development Goal 1: Poverty) it is important poverty remains one of the greatest challenges faced by humanity, affecting millions of people around the world by depriving them of access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, and healthcare. Addressing this issue is crucial not only for improving individual lives but also for fostering social equity, reducing inequalities, and creating stronger, more resilient communities. Poverty is often the root cause of numerous global problems, including hunger, poor health, lack of education, and even conflict, which makes its eradication a fundamental step toward achieving sustainable development. By advocating for this goal, I hope to raise awareness, inspire action, and contribute to creating a future where every person, regardless of their background or circumstances, has the opportunity to live a life of dignity, security,advocating for (Sustainable Development Goal 1: Poverty) it is important  ) </p>
